# SteelSoldierVR
This is a short VR demo created for Introduction to Virtual Reality at Rown University.

*SteelSoldier* allows the player to step into the shoes (or suit?) of the very blatant *Iron Man*-knockoff, SteelSoldier.
The player is given the ability to fly with repulsors located on the hands, shoot lasers, and launch rockets to survive waves of enemy aircraft.

The target platform for this game is the Oculus Rift.
